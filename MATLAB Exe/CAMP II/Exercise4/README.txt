The goal of this exercise is to compare the
classical level set approach of Chan and Vese
with the convex approach for solving the piecewise 
constant Mumford-Shah functional.
You will find two class definition files (SDFunction.m
and LFunction.m) as well as two script files which
implement the gradient descents for both approaches
(LevelSet.m and Convex.m).
Please complete the files Lfunction.m and
LevelSet.m by using the formulas provided in the lecture!
